Description
===========
JZlib is a re-implementation of zlib in pure Java.
The first and final aim for hacking this stuff is
to add the packet compression support to pure Java SSH systems.


Documentation
=============
* README files all over the source tree have info related to the stuff
  in the directories. 
* ChangeLog: what changed from the previous version?
* LICENSE.txt


Directories & Files in the Source Tree
======================================
* com/ has source trees of JZlib.
* example/ has some samples, which demonstrate the usages.
* misc/ has some stuffs. At present, this directory includes
  a patch file for MindTerm v.1.2.1, which adds the packet compression
  functionality.


Features
========
* Needless to say, JZlib can inflate data, which is deflated by zlib and
  JZlib can generate deflated data, which is acceptable and inflated by zlib.
* JZlib supports all compression level and all flushing mode in zlib. 
* JZlib does not support gzip file handling supports.
* The performance has not been estimated yet,  but it will be not so bad
  in deflating/inflating data stream on the low bandwidth network.
* JZlib is licensed under BSD style license.
* Any invention has not been done in developing JZlib.
  So, if zlib is patent free, JZlib is also not covered by any patents.


Why JZlib?
==========
Java Platform API provides packages 'java.util.zip.*' for
accessing to zlib, but that support is very limited 
if you need to use the essence of zlib. For example,
we needed to full access to zlib to add the packet compression
support to pure Java SSH system, but they are useless for our requirements.
The Internet draft, SSH Transport Layer Protocol, says in the section '4.2 Compression' as follows,

  The following compression methods are currently defined:
    none  REQUIRED  no compression
    zlib  OPTIONAL  GNU ZLIB (LZ77) compression
  The "zlib" compression is described in [RFC-1950] and in [RFC-1951]. The
  compression context is initialized after each key exchange, and is
  passed from one packet to the next with only a partial flush being
  performed at the end of each packet. A partial flush means that all data
  will be output, but the next packet will continue using compression
  tables from the end of the previous packet.

To implement this functionality, the Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH mode of zlib must be
used, however JDK does not permit us to do so. It seems that this problem has
been well known and some people have already reported to 
JavaSoft's BugParade(for example, BugId:4255743), 
but any positive response has not been returned from JavaSoft, 
so this problem will not be solved forever. 
This is our motivation to hack JZlib.


A unofficial patch for MindTerm v.1.2.1
=======================================
A unofficial patch file for MindTerm v.1.2.1 has included in 'misc' directory.
It adds the packet compression support to MindTerm. 
Please refer to 'misc/README' file.
